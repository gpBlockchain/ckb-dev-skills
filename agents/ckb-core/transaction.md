# Transaction

## Overview

A CKB transaction consumes existing Live Cells (inputs) and creates new Live Cells (outputs). All Scripts from the transaction are executed to validate correctness. If any Script fails, the entire transaction is rejected.

## Transaction Structure

```
Transaction: {
  version: Uint32;
  cell_deps: [CellDep];     // Cells referenced as dependencies (e.g., Script code)
  header_deps: [H256];      // Block headers referenced by the transaction
  inputs: [CellInput];      // Live Cells to consume
  outputs: [CellOutput];    // New Cells to create
  outputs_data: [Bytes];    // Data for each output Cell
  witnesses: [Bytes];       // Signatures and other proofs
}
```

### Key Fields

| Field          | Description                                                                                               |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cell_deps`    | References to Cells containing Script code or data needed during execution. These Cells are NOT consumed. |
| `inputs`       | Live Cells to be consumed. Each references a previous transaction output.                                 |
| `outputs`      | New Cells to be created. Each specifies capacity, lock, and optional type.                                |
| `outputs_data` | Data field for each corresponding output Cell (matched by index).                                         |
| `witnesses`    | Proofs (typically signatures) used by Scripts during validation.                                          |

## Transaction Flow

1. **Select inputs**: Choose Live Cells with enough capacity.
2. **Define outputs**: Specify new Cells with lock/type scripts and data.
3. **Balance capacity**: Sum of input capacities >= sum of output capacities. The difference is the transaction fee.
4. **Sign**: Place signatures in `witnesses`.
5. **Submit**: Send to a CKB node for validation and inclusion in a block.

## CKB Transaction Fee

```
fee = sum(input capacities) - sum(output capacities)
```

There is no explicit gas/fee field. The difference between total input and output capacity is the miner fee. A typical fee rate is around 1000 shannons per KB of serialized transaction size.

## cell_deps

`cell_deps` point to Cells that contain data needed during Script execution but are NOT consumed:

- Script code binaries (e.g., the secp256k1 Lock Script binary)
- Shared libraries or lookup data

```json
{
  "out_point": {
    "tx_hash": "0x...",
    "index": "0x0"
  },
  "dep_type": "code" // "code" or "dep_group"
}
```

- `dep_type: "code"` - The Cell's data is directly used.
- `dep_type: "dep_group"` - The Cell's data contains a list of out_points, all of which are loaded.

## witnesses

Witnesses provide off-chain data (usually signatures) for Script validation. The witness at index `i` corresponds to the Script group of input `i`.

## AI Dev Tips

- When composing transactions with CCC SDK, use `tx.completeInputsByCapacity(signer)` to auto-select inputs and `tx.completeFeeBy(signer)` to auto-calculate fees.
- Always ensure `outputs_data` array length matches `outputs` array length.
- A common mistake: forgetting to include Script code Cells in `cell_deps`.
- Transaction hash is calculated over all fields except `witnesses` (similar to Bitcoin's SegWit).

## Example: Simple CKB Transfer

```typescript
// Using CCC SDK
const tx = ccc.Transaction.from({
  outputs: [{ lock: toLock, capacity: ccc.fixedPointFrom(amount) }],
});
await tx.completeInputsByCapacity(signer);
await tx.completeFeeBy(signer);
const txHash = await signer.sendTransaction(tx);
```
