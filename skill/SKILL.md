# CKB Development Skill

## What this Skill is for

Use this Skill when the user asks for:

- CKB on-chain Script (smart contract) development
- Cell Model and UTXO-style state management
- Transaction building, signing, and sending on CKB
- DApp development with CCC SDK (TypeScript/JavaScript)
- Token creation and management (sUDT, xUDT, Spore DOB, RGB++)
- Wallet integration for CKB (Omnilock, JoyID, multi-wallet support)
- Testing and debugging CKB Scripts
- Deploying Scripts to Devnet/Testnet/Mainnet
- CKB-VM (RISC-V), cycles, and performance optimization
- Toolchain setup, version issues, build errors
- Molecule serialization format
- Running CKB nodes and RPC interaction
- Fiber Network (payment channels, invoices, multi-hop payments, cross-chain swaps)

## Default stack decisions (opinionated)

1. **Script language: Rust first**

- Prefer Rust with `ckb-std` for all new on-chain Scripts.
- Use C with `ckb-c-stdlib` only for extremely size/cycle-sensitive Scripts.
- Use JavaScript (ckb-js-vm) for prototyping or educational demos.

2. **DApp SDK: CCC first**

- Use `@ckb-ccc/shell` for Node.js backends.
- Use `@ckb-ccc/connector-react` for React frontends with wallet connection.
- Use `@ckb-ccc/ccc` for custom UI without built-in connector.

3. **Script project scaffolding**

- Use `cargo generate gh:cryptape/ckb-script-templates workspace` for new projects.
- Use `make generate CRATE=<name>` to add contracts within a project.

4. **Testing**

- Default: `ckb-testtool` for Rust unit tests (simulates full CKB environment).
- Use `ckb-debugger` for command-line execution, cycle profiling, and GDB debugging.
- Use `ckb-debugger --mode gdb` when you need step-through debugging.

5. **Deployment**

- Use OffCKB for local Devnet development.
- Use Type ID pattern for upgradable Scripts.
- Use `data2` hash_type for new Scripts (targets latest VM version).

6. **Serialization**

- CKB uses Molecule (not Protobuf/JSON) for on-chain data serialization.
- Use `@ckb-ccc/ccc` codecs for TypeScript, `molecule` crate for Rust.

## Operating procedure (how to execute tasks)

When solving a CKB task:

### 1. Classify the task layer

- Core concepts (Cell Model, Script, Transaction structure)
- On-chain Script development (Rust/C/JS)
- DApp / client-side development (CCC SDK, wallet)
- Payment channels and off-chain payments (Fiber Network)
- Testing and debugging
- Deployment and infrastructure

### 2. Pick the right building blocks

- Script development: Rust + ckb-std + ckb-script-templates
- DApp client: CCC SDK (@ckb-ccc/shell or @ckb-ccc/connector-react)
- Testing: ckb-testtool (Rust) + ckb-debugger (CLI)
- Local dev: OffCKB
- Payment channels: Fiber Network (fnn node + JSON-RPC)

### 3. Implement with CKB-specific correctness

Always be explicit about:

- Cell capacity requirements (minimum 61 CKBytes, recommend 62+)
- Lock Script vs Type Script distinction and execution rules
- `cell_deps` inclusion for referenced Script code
- `outputs_data` array matching `outputs` array length
- hash_type selection (`data2` for new, `type` for upgradable via Type ID)
- Transaction fee = sum(input capacities) - sum(output capacities)

### 4. Add tests

- Script tests: ckb-testtool with both success and failure cases.
- Transaction tests: verify cycle consumption is reasonable.
- Use `context.dump_tx()` to generate ckb-debugger transaction files.

### 5. Deliverables expectations

When you implement changes, provide:

- Exact files changed
- Commands to build (`make build`) and test (`make test`)
- Cycle consumption estimates where relevant
- Risk notes for anything touching signatures, token transfers, or capacity management
